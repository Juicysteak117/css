# [/r/CompetitiveOverwatch](https://reddit.com/r/competitiveoverwatch) CSS

**The CSS and images for [/r/CompetitiveOverwatch](https://reddit.com/r/competitiveoverwatch)**

###Notes
* CSS is based on the latest version of [Naut](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit), kept as a submodule (`naut`)
* All custom CSS is in `src/main.css`
* `src/blacklist.css` contains CSS to be removed from Naut (e.g. to save uploading images)

###Usage
* Clone the repo
* `git submodule update --init`
* `npm install`
* `npm run build` to 'build' the minified CSS and images to `dist`
