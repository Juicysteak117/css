# [/r/CompetitiveOverwatch](https://reddit.com/r/competitiveoverwatch) CSS & Images

###Notes
* CSS was originally based on Naut, which is now in the process of being merged in to remove the dependency and free up file space (based on Reddit's CSS size limit of 100 KB)
* All custom CSS is in `src/main.css`

###Usage
* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `npm run build` to build
* Find minified CSS and images in `dist`
